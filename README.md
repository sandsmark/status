Fairly simple thing to be used with i3bar.

Displays:
 - Battery percentage/charging state (if battery present)
 - Disk space free on all (relevant) partitions)
 - Current network traffic
 - Current system load
 - Memory free
 - CPU usage
 - Volume
 - Date (including week number because I always forget that) and time.

Also uses colors to highlight things like quickly rising memory usage, constant
high CPU usage (e. g. when I forgot to stop something running a busyloop) or
low disk space.

Probably not very useful for others, this is mostly for myself.
